# forum-fixer
sanitizes/reformats vBulletin, phpBB and other forum pages

Note: since this processes the page AFTER download, things like comment counts will reflect the raw number of comments
also, the browser still has to download the whole page; this extension provides no increase in speed

version 1 contains no external configuration, all the strings and logic are hardcoded
tested against vBulletin 4.2.4 Beta 1
